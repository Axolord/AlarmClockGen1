# Arduino alarm clock
This is a project about an Arduino Uno powered alarm clock with mp3 capabilites, using a dfplayer nano.
I build this alarm as part of my Abitur on my German school; you can read the PDF what I submitted as paper,
where everything is explained in detail (in german). 
Feel free to use the code for your own project or contact me for questions
